# Machine Learning Techniques

A compilation of my projects from which I followed tutorials on machine learning algorithms to get the hang of ML libraries such as tensor flow and sklearn.

Used simple techniques like K nearest neighbors and support vector machines as well as nueral nets and deep neural nets.
